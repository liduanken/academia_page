I am Dr Li Duan, a research associat at King's College London (KCL). My research interest is robot-assisted surgical intervention. I focus on breathing compensation that utilises homography estimation technologies to stablise endoscopy views for surgeons. My research facilitates a safe and effective surgery environment for both patients and surgeons.

I previously worked as a software developer at CGG(UK), a HPC provider for geophysical subsurface imging service. My duties included maintaining and developing a machine learning pipeline for fault-detecting and denoising seismic data. I collobrated with software engineers from other CGG centres (Houston and Singapore) to delivery high-quality services to our clients.

I obtained PhD from the University of Glasgow, where my PhD concentrates on robotic perception and manipulation of garments. The main challenges were understanding geometrical and physical properties of garments and inferring their deformations during manipulations. My PhD achieved an effective pipeline on unfolding garments of various types.
